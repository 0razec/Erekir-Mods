##Erekir Utilities
block.erekir-mods-combustion-chamber.name = Combustion Chamber
block.erekir-mods-combustion-chamber.description =Burns graphite and converts it into a small amount of energy.\n\n[#f8d490]Original Mod:[lightgray] Erekir Utilities\n[#f8d490]By:[lightgray] Azhurniy Baklan\n
block.erekir-mods-combustion-chamber.details= The Combustion Chamber generates 180 energy units, equaling the capacity of a standard capacitor. Developed to optimize the burning of graphite in a hostile environment, it is an effective solution for dealing with the excess of this resource or obtaining enough energy for factories.

##Kizrak-Radar
block.erekir-mods-kizrak-radar.name= Surge Radar
block.erekir-mods-kizrak-radar.description=Powerful wave radar capable of detecting at long distances.\n\n[#f8d490]Original Mod:[lightgray] Kizrak's Radar\n[#f8d490]By:[lightgray] Abaines Kizrak\n
block.erekir-mods-kizrak-radar.details =Uses radio waves to detect threats within a radius of up to 200 blocks, providing broad coverage. With real-time processing, it ensures that no enemy activity goes unnoticed. Its advanced technology is crucial for maintaining security in a hostile environment like Erekir, making it essential for defensive and offensive strategies.

##Erekir Junction

block.erekir-mods-beryllium-router.name= Duct Router
block.erekir-mods-beryllium-router.description=Distributes incoming items equally to 3 exit directions.\n\n[#f8d490]Original Mod:[lightgray] Erekir Junction\n[#f8d490]By:[lightgray] Adamlol_gaming\n
block.erekir-mods-beryllium-router.details= The duct router, besides being cheaper than the standard, can also be used as 2 inputs and 2 outputs. Perfect for handling in tight spaces with ducts.

block.erekir-mods-duct-junction.name= Duct Junction
block.erekir-mods-duct-junction.description=Functions as a pillar with two inputs for two ducts that are crossing.\n\n[#f8d490]Original Mod:[lightgray] Erekir Junction\n[#f8d490]By:[lightgray] Adamlol_gaming\n
block.erekir-mods-duct-junction.details= Essential for optimizing duct intersections, providing efficient support to avoid using bridges. Ensures a continuous flow of materials in both directions with a robust and inexpensive structure.

block.erekir-mods-duct-bridge-alt.name= Advanced Duct Bridge
block.erekir-mods-duct-bridge-alt.description=Advanced Duct Bridge transports items over terrain or constructions with a range of up to 5 blocks.\n\n[#f8d490]Original Mod:[lightgray] Erekir Junction\n[#f8d490]By:[lightgray] Adamlol_gaming\n
block.erekir-mods-duct-bridge-alt.details= Unlike the conventional duct bridge, this one allows at the terminal to distribute in up to 3 directions like a routing duct. Its function of choosing which terminal to connect the bridge allows for greater compactness and organization in transportation.
